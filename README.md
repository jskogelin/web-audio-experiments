## Prototype goals
#### Based on proximity to the audio source, change volume
* Math.hypot to get the proximity
* Create some algoritm to set the volume based on proximity in pixels

#### Based on position of cursor, change 
* Do this using the [StereoPannerNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/StereoPannerNode) API
* Depending on the position of the cursor, change the audio balance
